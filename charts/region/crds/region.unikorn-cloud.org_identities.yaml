          Identity defines an on-demand cloud identity.  The region controller must
          create any resources necessary to provide dynamic provisioning of clusters
          e.g. compute, storage and networking.  This resource is used for persistence
          of information by the controller and not for manual lifecycle management.
          Any credentials should not be stored unless absolutely necessary, and should
          be passed to a client on initial identity creation only.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.
